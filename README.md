# Self-Driving Racing Car Simulation using OpenAI Gym and Stable Baselines 3

## Overview

This repository contains a self-driving racing car simulation implemented using OpenAI Gym and Reinforcement Learning with Stable Baselines 3. The goal of this project is to train an autonomous agent to navigate a racing track and complete laps as fast as possible.

## Features

- Utilizes OpenAI Gym environment for the racing track simulation, providing a standardized interface for reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Implements the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm from Stable Baselines 3, a state-of-the-art RL library, to train the self-driving agent.
- Customizable environment and agent parameters to fine-tune the training process for different racing tracks and tasks.
- Visualization tools to observe the agent's performance and monitor training progress.
- Pre-trained model checkpoints for quick start and transfer learning on similar racing tracks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- OpenAI Gym
- Stable Baselines 3
